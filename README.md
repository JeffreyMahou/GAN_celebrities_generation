# GAN_celebrities_generation

Download Celeb-A Faces dataset : https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
download "Align&Cropped Images" and store it as a folder at the root of this github

when running the program :
--path : 'path to the folder'
--name_images : 'name of the images folder'
--name_gen : 'name of the generator weights file' (optional)
--name_discr : 'name of the discriminator weights file' (optional)


The weights uploaded are not necessarily optimal, they were just trained on 5 epochs and without fine tuning but still give a decent result
